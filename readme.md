#THE SOLAR SYSTEM
This past weekend I went to visit my family in the suburbs of CT. A place where a major city was miles away and the sky was illuminated with stars and constellations. My younger brother who is 9, is very inquisitive and well never refrain from asking questions. Upon stargazing he would actively ask questions about the moon, the stars, how does gravity work. In the midst of those questions I figured out what I wanted to do. I wanted to create a solar system that would help kids around his age learn about the planets, and depth of space. But for me I didn't want to just make a solar system that moved, I wanted to grab thier attention and keep them on the page, and creating a changeble background was a must for me. I have always had an inquisition for outer space and the deep sea, and this project definetly illustrates one of those queries.
