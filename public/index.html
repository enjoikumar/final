		<li>
		<h2 id="sun">Sun</h2>
		<p>The sun lies at the heart of the solar system, where it is by far the largest object. It holds 99.8 percent of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the diameter of the Earth — about one million Earths could fit inside the sun.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mercury">Mercury</h2>
		<p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the one closest to the Sun, with an orbital period of about 88 Earth days, which is much faster than any other planet in the Solar System. Seen from Earth, it appears to move around its orbit in about 116 days. It has no known natural satellites</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="venus">Venus</h2>
		<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the second brightest object in the night sky after the Moon. Named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, Venus is the second largest terrestrial planet and is sometimes referred to as the Earth's sister planet due the their similar size and mass.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="earth">Earth</h2>
		<p>It is the only planet that has an atmosphere containing 21 percent oxygen. It is the only planet that has liquid water on its surface. It is the only planet in the solar system that has life. The Earth is the only inner planet (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) to have one large satellite, the Moon.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mars">Mars</h2>
		<p>Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="jupiter">Jupiter</h2>
		<p>The planet Jupiter is the fifth planet out from the Sun, and is two and a half times more massive than all the other planets in the solar system combined. It is made primarily of gases and is therefore known as a “gas giant.”</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="saturn">Saturn</h2>
		<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="uranus">Uranus</h2>
		<p>The planet is often dubbed an ice giant, since 80 percent or more of its mass is made up of a fluid mix of water, methane, and ammonia ices. Unlike the other planets of the solar system, Uranus is tilted so far that it essentially orbits the sun on its side, with the axis of its spin nearly pointing at the star.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="neptune">Neptune</h2>
		<p>Despite being smaller than Uranus, Neptune has a greater mass. Below its heavy atmosphere, Uranus is made of layers of hydrogen, helium, and methane gases. They enclose a layer of water, ammonia and methane ice. The inner core of the planet is made of rock.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="pluto">Pluto</h2>
		<p>Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond Neptune. It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered.</p>
